# xG Overachievers

In football, **xG (expected goals)** represents the number of goals a player or a team is supposed to score based on the shots he has taken.
However, this is an average representation meaning some players score more than what they are expected to (*overachievers*), and other players less (*underachievers*).

This project aims to provide a representation of those players in order to shed a new light on their performances.
